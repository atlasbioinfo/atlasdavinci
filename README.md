# atlas Davinci
This script is a simplified version of Davinci algorithm from the paper published in Nature (DOI: 10.1038/s41586-022-05135-9). It supports direct mutation calling using Davinci algorithm from Nanopore sequencing BAM files after alignment.

## Features

- Direct processing of Nanopore BAM files
- Implementation of core Davinci algorithm
- Simplified workflow compared to the original paper
- Variant calling optimized for Nanopore data

## Usage
